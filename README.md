# letter-by-letter-appearance
Letter-by-letter display when a block appears on the screen

The "letter_by_letter" class is responsible for translating the string into separate letter blocks. If you need to change it, there is a variable "block_name" in the js file where you need to insert your new class and change it accordingly in the css file.
